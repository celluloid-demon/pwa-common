# Readme

Wanted progressive web apps made with Chromium to be more portable across system migrations than they currently are.

This is a mono-repo that can run several web apps from the same chromium-gui image. To make a new web app, just copy a web app folder as a starting point and customize the `docker-compose.yml`, `settings` and `*.desktop` files. To run from your application launcher, place the `*.desktop` file in the appropriate directory on your system.
